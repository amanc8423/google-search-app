1. mpm run dev vs npm start
2. {quickLinks.map((menu,index)=>(
    <span key={index} className="text-[#70757a] text-[12px] md:text-[14px] leading-none p-[10px] md:p-[15px]">
        {menu}
    </span>
))}     vs {quickLinks.map((menu,index)=>{
    <span key={index} className="text-[#70757a] text-[12px] md:text-[14px] leading-none p-[10px] md:p-[15px]">
        {menu}
    </span>
})}   why first one working but not second one

The first code snippet is using parentheses () to enclose the function body, which is a shorthand syntax for an implicit return. This means that the function will automatically return the value of the expression inside the parentheses.

On the other hand, the second code snippet is using curly braces {} to enclose the function body. This syntax requires an explicit return statement to return a value from the function.

Therefore, in the second code snippet, the function body is not returning anything explicitly, which means that it will return undefined. As a result, nothing will be rendered in the JSX.

To fix the issue, you can add a return statement inside the function body in the second code snippet:

less
Copy code
{quickLinks.map((menu,index)=>{
    return (
        <span key={index} className="text-[#70757a] text-[12px] md:text-[14px] leading-none p-[10px] md:p-[15px]">
            {menu}
        </span>
    );
})}
Alternatively, you can use the shorthand syntax with parentheses to implicitly return the JSX:

javascript
Copy code
{quickLinks.map((menu,index)=>(
    <span key={index} className="text-[#70757a] text-[12px] md:text-[14px] leading-none p-[10px] md:p-[15px]">
        {menu}
    </span>
))}
Both of these approaches should work correctly.

is this property of reactjs or it also works in js

The shorthand syntax for an implicit return using parentheses () is a feature of JavaScript, not specifically React. It's a relatively new syntax that was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and is commonly used in modern JavaScript development.

However, the use of this syntax in the context of React components is specific to React. In a React component, the curly braces {} are used to evaluate JavaScript expressions within JSX, while parentheses () are used to enclose JSX expressions that should be implicitly returned from a function.

So while the shorthand syntax for an implicit return using parentheses is a general JavaScript feature, its specific usage within the context of React components is unique to React.
